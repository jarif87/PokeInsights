# Project_Pokemon

## Problem Statement

**The goal of the project is to gather information about the best Pokémon in terms of their attack, defense, and speed, while also determining which types of Pokémon perform better. Additionally, I will scrape data from the [website](https://pokemondb.net/pokedex/all) to achieve this objective.**


### Build from sources and run the Selenium Scraper
**1.Clone the repository:**
>git clone https://github.com/jarif87/Project_Pokemon/tree/main.git

**2.Initialize and active Virtual Environment:**
>virtualenv venv

>.\venv\Scripts\activate

**3.Install dependencies:**
>pip install -r requirements.txt

**4.Run the scrape:**
>python Project_Pokemon/Pokemon.py

**5.You will receive a file named "Pokemon.csv," which contains all the required fields. Alternatively, you can review our scraped data by checking it [here](https://github.com/jarif87/Project_Pokemon/blob/main/Pokemon.csv)**
