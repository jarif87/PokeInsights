# Project_Pokemon

## Problem Statement

**The goal of the project is to gather information about the best Pokémon in terms of their attack, defense, and speed, while also determining which types of Pokémon perform better. Additionally, I will scrape data from the [website](https://pokemondb.net/pokedex/all) to achieve this objective.**
